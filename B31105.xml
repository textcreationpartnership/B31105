         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A RELATION Of the late Action between the French and Dutch At <hi>Tobago</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THe deſires and Curioſity of ſome People, and eſpecially thoſe who were my Friends, hath made me a little more then commonly Induſtrious to procure the beſt Intelligence I could Poſſibly to give them ſatisfaction concerning the diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Tobago,</hi> which is as follows.</p>
            <p>Some time ſince we had an Account how Count <hi>D'Eſtrees</hi> had aſſaulted <hi>Tobago</hi> with great Reſolution both by Sea and Land, in which there was great Loſs ſuffered on both ſides, which by the firſt advice, was, That Eleven of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships were loſt, and only four of the <hi>French,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> were totally worſted by Land; The ſecond ſeemed to ſpeak much to the ſame purpoſe, only ſomewhat more favourable of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which is the leſs to be regarded, becauſe all theſe Intelligences came by the way of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received the leaſt intimation from the Sieur <hi>Binches,</hi> nor from any other hand of certainty that can believe, but what they received from <hi>England,</hi> by a Ship lately Arrived there from ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies adjacent to the ſaid <hi>Tobago.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Count <hi>D'Eſtrees</hi> by the King his Maſters particular command and appointment, was to provide himſelf with ſuch a Force and Power, as might not only be able to annoy the <hi>Dutch</hi> in thoſe Parts, but to reduce <hi>Tobago,</hi> which the <hi>Dutch</hi> had taken from the <hi>French</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſince, To which purpoſe he put on Board Two Thouſand Souldiers, ſome Hundreds of Gentlemen Volunteers and Planters,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:199679:2"/>beſides a large proportion of Marriners above his Complement; with this Fleet which conſiſted of near Twenty Sail, or thereabouts, great and ſmall, being Ships for the moſt part of very conſiderable force, and much Superior to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> they arrived in the ſame place the latter end of <hi>February</hi> 1676, where the Count <hi>D'Eſtrees</hi> called a Council of VVar, to conſider which was the beſt way to Attaque the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and by a general conſent and allowance it was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both by Sea and Land at one time, to which purpoſe 1500 men was put on Shore, under the Command of the <hi>Sieurs Grand Fountain</hi> and <hi>Horovard;</hi> and the Conduct and care of the Fleet to the Count <hi>D'Eſtrees</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>The Dutch in the mean time, as it highly concerned them to reſiſt ſuch a Power, was not wanting to make the moſt conſiderable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence they could, and therefore had very ſtrongly fortified themſelves at Land, and for their better ſecurity next the Sea, had built a Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, on which was mounted 30. Piece of Ordnance, under whoſe Protection their Ships lay, and was the chief occaſion of the <hi>French</hi> loſs, for the Dutch being weak in Shiping, were forced only to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, being moov'd as near as conveniently they could along the Shore by the Plat-form, which was very vigorouſly aſſaulted by the ſaid Count, and a moſt ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tinate Fight continued for ſome hours, wherein the Dutch loſt near their whole Fleet, being eleven in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, amongſt which was the <hi>Defender</hi> in which the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Notwithſtanding the ſaid loſs on the Dutch ſide, 'twas impoſſible to diſſodge them from the Plat-form, which they maintained with ſo much Reſolution and Courage, that after the Count had attempted it with as much gallantry as was poſſible for any Man, was forc'd to decline it, and leave five or ſix of his Ships buried in the Ocean, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides two that fell into the Enemies hands, as an everlaſting Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his undoubted Gallantry. His own Ship the <hi>Glorieux</hi> being Fired caſually, being a Veſſel of 72 Braſs Guns, and near 500 Men, was reſolved not to ſurvive ſo great a diſappointment, but that at length, by the perſwaſion of ſome, himſelf with ſome few others, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped a ſhore in a ſhallop, where he met with that unwelcome news
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:199679:3"/>of the Defeat of his Forces at Land, where the Dutch had (for they certainly expected a viſit from the <hi>French</hi>) ſo ſtrengthned themſelves, that had the <hi>French</hi> been double the number they were, they could not in Reaſon have prevailed. For the Dutch had raiſed a new Fort, wherein were ſeveral Pieces of Ordnance in a moſt advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Place, and though it was bravely attempted by the <hi>French</hi> ſeveral times, they were ſtill beaten off with very great Slaughter, wherein the Sieurs <hi>Herovard</hi> and <hi>Baincourt,</hi> with ſeveral Officers of Note were ſlain, beſides by water
